# City Dine Recommendation System

## Overview
This project involves developing a Restaurant Recommendation System using machine learning. The system predicts restaurant ratings based on user preferences such as city location, cuisine, and budget.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data from various sources including restaurant databases and user reviews.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **EDA**: Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and derive insights.
4. **Model Building**: Built and trained a Decision Tree Regression model to predict restaurant ratings.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance and fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
6. **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzed patterns in restaurant ratings to enhance the model's performance.

## Results
The model achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy in predicting restaurant ratings based on user preferences.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to build a restaurant recommendation system.
